    <h2>There are 4 pillars of programming</h2>

    <h3>Variables</h3>

    <!-- The script tags they specify that we are now coding with JavaScript - a whole new set of rules apply in JavaScript -->
    <script>
        // This is a single-line JavaScript comment

        /*
            This is a multi-line Javascript comment
        */
       
        // a variable stores a piece of information
        // variables should have descriptive names

        // use descriptive variable names, such as firstName
        // let is the best way to create a JavaScript variable

        let firstName = "Ryanne";

        // var and let are basically equivalent for the purposes of this class - but use let cause its better
        var lastName = "Kinnaman";


    </script>

    <h3>Functions</h3>

    <script>
        // lets talk about functions - fuctions are a way to organize chunks of code; functions also allow us to write code 1 time and reuse it as many times as we need to
        // when creating a function in JavaScript, use the keyword function to let the interpreter know that you are creating a resuable chunk of code
        // we create a descriptive name for what our function will do; most of the time our function names should include a verb ; start function names with a letter, you can use numbers and _
        // camelCase or snake_case for naming styles - use whichever one you want, but stay consistent
        // after the function name, use parentheses ( ) whether or not you are passing values into the function
        // the function code must be placed within curly braces { }
        function addNumbers(){
            // create 2 variables so we can add them together
            let number1 = 5; // we are hard-coding the value of 5 here
            let number2 = 8;

            //create another varible to hold the sum
            let sum = number1 + number2;

            // write out the sum to the console
            // to concatenate (add text together), you can use + or ,
            console.log("The sum is: ", sum)
        }

        // this line of code, calls the function so we can test it
        addNumbers();
    </script>

    <h3>Decision Logic (if/else)</h3>

    <script>    
        // when testing an if statement, make sure to use == (equality) instead of = (assignment: this will change the value of your variable, which you probably dont want)
        // in an if chunk of code, you will have 1 and only 1 if statement, you can have as many else if as needed, and optionally, 1 else statment
        // && is and - both conditions must evaluate to true
        // || is or - only 1 condtion must evaluate to true
        if (firstName == "Ryanne" || lastName == "Kinnaman"){
            // since the value in firstName is Ryanne, this code will run
            console.log("Ryanne is here");
        }
        else if ( firstName == "Rae2"){
            console.log("Ryanne is here");
        }
        // else is the catch-all so when the if statement evaluates to false, the else will run
        else{
            console.log("Ryanne is not here")
        }
    </script>
